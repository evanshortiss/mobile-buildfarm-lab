## Introduction

_Note_: This lab assumes you've completed the starter OpenShift labs and are
familiar with basic OpenShift concepts.

Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery are two separate but closely
concepts that help us to build better software. CI provides feedback to the
developers that enables them to quickly determine if they broke anything and
that they're building an application correctly. CD provides frequent builds 
such that software can be rapidaly deployed, tested, and released.

In this lab we'll create a continious integration and continuous delivery
pipeline for a native Android application using a Jenkins CI instance deployed
on OpenShift, and https://github.com/aerogear/aerogear-digger[AeroGear Digger].
We'll also integrate our application with Kryptowire for deep security scanning
of our binaries to continuosuly have security at the forefront of our
development processes.

## How is Mobile Different?

The truth is that mobile isn't all that different conceptually, but they're are
some unique challenges.

Delivery requires pushing applications to an MDM or other target such as
Google's Play Store or Apple's App Store.

The environment in which your application is deployed also isn't consistent due
to the vast number of OS versions and vendors in the marketplace. You might need
to test across these different devices via Google's Firebase Test Lab.

On-device security is also a significant factor in mobile development.
Typical users entrust their mobile devices and applications with access to
sensitive data from banking to emails. Applications containing vulnerabilities
can be exploited by malicious actors to divulge sensitive data or provide attack
vectors.

Finally, mobile CI/CD has typically had few to none available open source
solutions that can be deployed in on-premise, hybird, or public cloud
environments to meet the needs of enterprises and goverment.

## AeroGear Android Showcase Application

The https://github.com/aerogear/android-showcase-template[Android Showcase] is a
native Android application designed to demonstrate the capabilities that
Red Hat's mobile SDKs and Mobile Services on OpenShift
offer.

Since it is a native Android application it is built using Java and the Android 
SDKs. To compile  this application we'll need to have Java and the Android SDKs
installed on the CI platform alongside a plethora of other supporting libraries
and tools.

## AeroGear Digger

Digger is an AeroGear opensource project that provides a solution to creating a
mobile CI/CD pipeline on OpenShift. 

Digger will manage the configuration of mobile SDKs, Kubernetes Pods, and
provides utilities for signing, archiving, and distributing via the Jenkinsfile
in an mobile project repository.

## Jenkins CI Engine
Jenkins is a self-contained, extensible, open source automation server which can
be used to automate all sorts of tasks such as building, testing, and deploying
software.

Although Jenkins was first popular as a continuous integration engine, its usage
domain soon expanded to other areas such as Continuous Delivery pipelines due to
its sheer popularity.

Jenkins enjoys a very active community which has built out hundreds of plugins
to extend Jenkins to automate almost anything. Jenkins provides support for all
popular source code management systems (SCM), popular build tools, as well as
testing frameworks and report generators. The latest major release of Jenkins
included a powerful Continuous Delivery pipeline support using a Groovy Domain
Specific Language (DSL) which is referred to as Pipeline as Code.

## OpenShift Container Platform
OpenShift is a container application platform from Red Hat that builds on top of
docker and Kubernetes to to let you easily and quickly build, develop, 
and deploy containerized applications in nearly any infrastructure, public or
private. OpenShift is optimized for continuous application development and
multi-tenant deployment. OpenShift adds developer and operations-centric tools
on top of Kubernetes to enable rapid application development, easy deployment
and scaling, and long-term lifecycle maintenance for small and large teams.

OpenShift builds a developer-centric workflow around Docker containers and
Kubernetes runtime concepts. There are few concepts you need to be familiar with
when using OpenShift:

_Container_: Linux containers are lightweight mechanisms for isolating running
processes so that they are limited to interacting with only their designated
resources.

_Image_: a binary that includes all of the requirements for running a single
container, as well as metadata describing its needs and capabilities.

_Image Registry_: a service for storing and retrieving docker-formatted container images. A registry contains a collection of one or more image repositories.

_Pod_: one or more containers deployed together on one host, and the smallest compute unit that can be defined, deployed, and managed.

_Image Stream_: lets you easily tag, import, and publish docker images from the integrated image registry in OpenShift.

_Build Config_: allows you to launch docker builds, build directly from source code or application binary, or trigger Jenkins Pipeline jobs whenever an image stream tag is updated. 

_Deployment Config_: allows you to redeploy whenever a new image becomes available.

_Service_: an internal load balancer which identifies a set of pods in order to proxy the connections it receives to them. Backing pods can be added to or removed from a service arbitrarily while the service remains consistently available, enabling anything that depends on the service to refer to it at a consistent address.

_Route_: make it trivial to expose your Kubernetes services via a public DNS name.

_Template_: describes a set of objects (pods, build configs, deployment configs, etc) that can be parameterized and processed to produce a list of objects for creation by OpenShift.

As an administrator, you can enable your developers to request new Projects which come with predefined roles, quotas, and security controls to fairly divide access.

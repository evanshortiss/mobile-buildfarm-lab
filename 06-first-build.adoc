## Triggering a Mobile Build

Start the first build by clicking the *Start Build* button, or by using the icon
to the right of the *Build Config* name to open a menu and choose *Start Build*
from there.

Once the Build starts it will provide updates via the OpenShift UI in realtime.
The Build is broken down into *Stages* as part of a *Pipeline*. These stages
are defined in the https://github.com/aerogear/android-showcase-template/blob/master/Jenkinsfile[Jenkinsfile]
included in the root of the Android Showcase application repository.

```Jenkinsfile
// Android Jenkinsfile
node("android"){
  stage("Checkout"){
    checkout scm
  }

  stage ("Prepare"){
    sh 'chmod +x ./gradlew'
  }

  stage("Build"){
    if (params.BUILD_CONFIG == 'release') {
      sh './gradlew clean assembleRelease' // builds app/build/outputs/apk/app-release.apk file
    } else {
      sh './gradlew clean assembleDebug' // builds app/build/outputs/apk/app-debug.apk
    }
  }

  stage("Archive"){
    if (params.BUILD_CONFIG == 'release') {
      archiveArtifacts artifacts: 'app/build/outputs/apk/**/app-release.apk', excludes: 'app/build/outputs/apk/*-unaligned.apk'
    } else {
      archiveArtifacts artifacts: 'app/build/outputs/apk/**/app-debug.apk', excludes: 'app/build/outputs/apk/*-unaligned.apk'
    }
  }
}
```

This Jenkinsfile performs the following actions:

* Retrieve the application source code from a Git repository
* Run tasks required to prepare the Build
* Execute the Gradle build to compile the application
* Archive the application binary for download later

These steps will look as follows from the OpenShift UI.

Open your Jenkins instance via the URL http://jenkins-myproject.{{OPENSHIFT_HOSTNAME}}.
Once logged in you can see the Build progress similar to that shown in the
OpenShift UI.

You can also access the logs for the build should you need to perform debugging
or find out why a build is failing.

Once the Build completes you can click the "Download" button in the OpenShift UI
to retrieve the apk file for installation on an Android device or emulator. A QR
code is also generated to simplify installation on a test device using a QR code
scanner.

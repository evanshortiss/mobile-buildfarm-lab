## Provision Digger

Using the tabs in your Application's details screen switch from the
*Configuration* to *Builds* section. This screen will inform us that we need to
provision a *Mobile CI/CD Service* to create builds as shown.

Click the button displayed to navigate to the *Catalog* and from the *Mobile*
tab choose the *Mobile CI/CD Service*.

Click the *Mobile CI/CD* link then enter *yes* into the 
*Android SDK License Agreement* box and leave the *Android SDK Package Config* 
with the default values and click *Create*.

Navigate to your project and you'll see that a Jenkins application is being 
provisioned using the selected *Mobile CI/CD APB*. This provisions three
Applications that comprise the Mobile CI/CD Service:

* jenkins-persistent
* artifact-proxy
* android-sdk-persistent

You can expand the
*jenkins-persistent* Application to see it accepts external connections via the
route https://jenkins-$YOURPROJECT.{{OPENSHIFT_URL}}

While you wait for the Jenkins instance to start you can explore the OpenShift 
UI and view the Jenkins environment configuration. Navigating to
*Applications > Deployments > jenkins* will allow you to see that we've
configured Jenkins to use OpenShift as an OAuth provider.

Once the deployment is complete you will see the three Applications listed
earlier on the  Overview screen of your Project, each with one running Pod.

From the Overview screen of your Project click the Jenkins URL
https://jenkins-$YOURPROJECT.{{OPENSHIFT_URL}} to access Jenkins. You should be
presented with the following page.

Click the *Log in with OpenShift* button, enter your credentials when prompted,
and then accept the requested permissions. Once complete, you'll be logged into
the Jenkins instance and can perform administrative tasks.

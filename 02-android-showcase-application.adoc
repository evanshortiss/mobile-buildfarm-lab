## Explore the Showcase Application

Our showcase application is located
https://github.com/aerogear/android-showcase-template[here] on GitHub. You
should fork it to your own GitHub account for the purpose of this tutorial. Use
the fork button in the top-right the repository page to do this. Once the
forking completes you should clone it locally to your workspace using:

```bash
$ cd workspace
$ git clone https://github.com/YOURACCOUNT/android-showcase-template
$ cd android-showcase-template
```

`Run > Run 'app'` option from the menu to start the application in an emulator. 
A `Select Deployment Target` window should open and from here you can choose
"Create New Virtual Device".

moments to compile your application and launch the emulator, but will look as
follows once complete.

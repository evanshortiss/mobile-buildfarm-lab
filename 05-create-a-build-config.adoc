## Create a Build Config

Now that we've registered our Mobile Application in OpenShift and provisioned a
*Mobile CI/CD* Service we can create a *Build Config* for our application.

Navigate back to your Application and to the *Build* tab again. This time the
tab contents will look different and instead prompt you to create a
*Build Config* as shown.

Click the button to create a *Build Config*. This will load a form that requests
additional information that will be used by the *Build Config* to access your
source code, determine if the build is a *debug* or *production*, and inject
environment variables to customise the build process.

Enter the following infromation in the form:

* Name - android-showcase-debug
* Git Repository URL - https://github.com/YOURACCOUNT/android-showcase-template
* Authentication - Public
* Build Type - Debug

A sample of the completed form is shown below.

We used *Public* sa the *Authentication* setting since our repository is public
on GitHub, but it's possible to use private Git repositories with industry
standard authetication methods such as *SSH Keys*.

Once you complete and submit the form you will be presented with an updated
Build tab that displays your new *Build Config* like as shown.

That's it, we now have a *Build Config* and are ready to start our first build.

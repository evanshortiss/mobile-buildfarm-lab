## Prerequisites

To participate in this workshop you'll need the following installed on your

#### Git

You can install Git using the instructions at https://git-scm.com/[Git SCM]. 
This workshop is tested on *Git 2.14* and above.

An installation can be verified by simply running this command in a terminal:

```bash
git --version
```

#### Android Studio

Installers for https://developer.android.com/studio/[Android Studio] can be

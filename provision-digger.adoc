## Provision Digger

Navigate to your OpenShift instance at {{OPENSHIFT_URL}} and sign in using your 
assigned user name and password.

After signing you'll be presented with the service catalog on the left and your 
project on the right. Choose "Mobile" from the Catalog and you should see a
screen similar to that shown below.

Click the "Mobile CI/CD" link then enter "yes" into the 
`Android SDK License Agreement` box and leave the `Android SDK Package Config` 
with the default values and click "Create".

Navigate to your project and you'll see that a Jenkins application is being 
provisioned using the selected "Mobile CI/CD" APB. You can expand the
`jenkins-persistent` Application to see it accepts external connections via the
route https://jenkins-$YOURPROJECT.{{OPENSHIFT_URL}}

While you wait for the Jenkins instance to start you can explore the OpenShift 
UI and view the Jenkins environment configuration. Navigating to
`Applications > Deployments > jenkins` will allow you to see that we've
configured Jenkins to use OpenShift as an OAuth provider.

## Register an Application

To get started, lets register our application in an OpenShift Project.
Registering the application will allow us to perform various actions related to
our mobile application in OpenShift including:

* Associating Services with our Application
* Generating an SDK *mobile-config.json* file
* Integrating with the Mobile CI/CD Service

Navigate to your OpenShift and sign in using your user name and password. View
the *Catalog* in OpenShift and choose the *Mobile* tab. From here you'll be
presented with various options for mobile related services and applications.
Choose *Android* from the list and follow the onscreen instructions and enter
the values requested as shown below.

_Note: The package name is found in the https://github.com/aerogear/android-showcase-template/blob/master/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml[AndroidManifest.xml]
or https://github.com/aerogear/ios-showcase-template/blob/master/ios-showcase-template/Info.plist[Info.plist] for iOS applications. This is a reverse domain name style string that uniquely identifies your application._

Once the application is registered head to your Project and you'll see that it's
listed on the Overview page. Clicking the arrow on the left will expand the
Application entry and display more details as shown below.

Now that we've registered our Mobile Application in OpenShift we can explore the
*Build* section for the Application. Click the Appliction's name in the
*Overview* screen and you'll be presented with the Configuration details for the
Application as shown.

Key information displayed here includes:

* *API Key* - This will be presented when the application makes calls to services
* *Client Type* - iOS, Android, Cordova, etc.
* *Client ID* - The package naem of the client
* *SDK Configuration* - A guide to configuring the SDK for your client application
* *Mobile Client Config* - A configuration that will be updated as we
provision mobile services for your application to integrate with. This should
be added to any application as *mobile-config.json*, and will be used by our
SDKs to interact with mobile services provisioned on OpenShift.

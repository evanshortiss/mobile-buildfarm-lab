## Showcase Application

Our showcase application is located
https://github.com/aerogear/android-showcase-template[here] on GitHub.

You should fork it to your own GitHub account for the purpose of this tutorial. 
Use the fork button in the top-right the repository page to do this.

Once the fork completes you should clone it locally using a variant of the 
following commands:

Next, open Android Studio, click "Open an existing Android Studio project"
and choose the directory we just cloned.

Once the project is loaded in Android Studio you should be able to use the
`Run > Run 'app'` option from the menu to start the application in an emulator. 
A `Select Deployment Target` window should open and from here you can choose
"Create New Virtual Device".

After clicking "Finish" on the final dialog you will be able to launch your
application on the newly created Google Pixel 2 emulator. It will take a few
moments to compile your application and launch the emulator, but will look as
follows once complete.

## Prerequisites

To participate in this workshop you'll need the following installed on your
machine.

### Git

You can install Git using the instructions at https://git-scm.com/[Git SCM]. 
This workshop is tested on Git 2.14 and above.


### Android Studio

Install https://developer.android.com/studio/[Android Studio] from this link.

Once Android Studio is installed you'll need to download some SDKs and Emulator 
images. You can do this by opening Android Studio and choosing 
`Tools > Android > SDK Manager`.

### Node.js v8.x

There are various methods for installing Node.js in your development
environment, but we recommend using https://github.com/creationix/nvm[nvm].
`nvm` will allow you to easily swicth Node.js versions at anytime from a
terminal and also installs using sensible permissions that avoid ownership/sudo
issues.

Once `nvm` is installed you can install specific Node.js versions like so, and
can be as specific as you like with the version tag:

```
$ nvm install 8
$ nvm use 8
```


### npm v5.x

The npm CLI will be installed alongside Node.js, but ensure you have at least
version 5 of npm installed like so:

```
$ npm install -g npm@5
```


### Digger CLI

Once you have Node.js and npm installed, the Digger CLI can be installed via npm
using the command `npm install -g aerogear-digger-node-client`.
